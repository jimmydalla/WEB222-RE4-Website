                <p>
                    Resident Evil 4 Remake is a 2023 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is a remake of the 2005 game Resident Evil 4. Players control the US agent Leon S. Kennedy, who must save Ashley Graham, the daughter of the United States president, from the mysterious Los Illuminados cult.

The remake retains the core gameplay of the original game, but with updated graphics, controls, and mechanics. The graphics are powered by the RE Engine, which was also used for Resident Evil 2 Remake and Resident Evil 3 Remake. The controls have been modernized to feel more fluid and responsive. And the mechanics have been tweaked to make the game more challenging and immersive.

The remake also features a reimagined storyline that expands on the events of the original game. Some characters have been redesigned, and new story elements have been added. This makes the remake feel fresh and exciting, even for fans who are familiar with the original game.

Resident Evil 4 Remake was released on March 23, 2023 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Microsoft Windows. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its updated visuals, gameplay, and story. It was also a commercial success, selling over 3 million copies in its first week of release.
